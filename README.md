## About Me

I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology. With a solid foundation in programming and a growing interest in distributed systems, I'm currently expanding my skills in modern web development and cloud platforms.

I'm a strong communicator and a quick learner who believes in writing clean, efficient, and scalable code. Whether it’s front-end design or back-end logic, I like understanding how systems work end-to-end.
